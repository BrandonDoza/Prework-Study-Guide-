# <Prework-Study-Guide-Webpage>

## Description

This webpage provides an easy to use guide to help students, new to web development, access information on the subjects they will be studying throughout the Bootcamp course. By keeping information organized and easy to access, this webpage helps students exceed in their web development process. Building this webpage taught me how to implement HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create a well designed and user friendly webpage. It also allowed me to become familiar with the Github process, so I may contribute and partner with my fellow developers

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
